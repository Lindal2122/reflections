What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
So you can start working with your code.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
You have not commited files to the master branch unless you stage it and then move it to the master version. You don't have to commit files you are not ready to add that you can work on in your working directory.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
You should only add content that covers one change at a time to a commit. So you can later troubleshoot if necessary or revert files if you create an error with your new code.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?
When you are testing out changing or experimenting with your project for other capabilities or functions, but don't want it to affect the master path of the project unless implemented. Also to fix a bug, to test and fix as a separate project.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
Allow you to visualize where your changes were from and what changes/fixes the master branch has had since you moved onto a separete branch.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?
It will update the master to include the new code created to be part of the project now so that any other changes will include the new content.
The diagram helps you see what changes were going to be included in the merge and which are still separate branches that are not part of the master.

What are the pros and cons of Gits automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
You don't have to solve the easy merge issues. The negative is either person may have removed some necessary code introducing an issue that will not be caught till later.
